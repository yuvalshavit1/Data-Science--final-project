There are many movies on the Netflix website, how do we choose which movie to watch?

Our project will revolve around the world of movies. We wanted to take a world of data that we are interested in. We went through a process to find the right research questions that surveyed us while we could learn something new from it with the tools we acquired in this course.

Our research questions:
Which films receive the "most liked" tag over the years and what sets them apart from other films?
In our project we compared all the movies that exist on the Netflix website in different categories and in the end we concluded which of the movies received the "most liked" tag and what distinguishes them from others.

We used Selenium to extract all the data from Netflix and the project was written in Python in combination with numpy and pandas libraries

We hope you enjoy the project.
